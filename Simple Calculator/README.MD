# Javascript Calculator

:heavy_plus_sign: :heavy_minus_sign: :heavy_multiplication_x: :heavy_division_sign:
This is a simple online calculator made with basic JavaScript. I made it just to practice styling and scripting.
It has a [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/Gi4eEfCRKPGmauE4UQ3zSB/Simple-Calculator?node-id=0%3A1&t=SjMFcrZhtPg2WKqN-0).
I used this [tutorial](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/building-a-calculator-a-javascript-project-for-beginners/) to get started.

## Operations

The calculator supports `addition`, `multiplication`, `subtraction`, `division`. `Nth root` and `percentage`.
You can also `clear the display` and `delete a number`.
`Decimals` are supported. 
The display will automatically add `separators` for the thousands. The display will show an ellipsis when there is overflow.

Future implementation: color theme picker, possibly limit the characters in the display in  JS instead of CSS overflow.
